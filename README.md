# Magma

A Lavalink connector written in Python, translated from Fre_d's Java Lavalink client.
Magma is the best Python Lavalink connector right now, as it is flawlessly incorporated into Himebot, a music bot with over 160k servers.
 
### Requirements:
* Lavalink v3
* discord.py, rewrite (any other version should work just fine)
* asyncio
* websockets
* aiohttp

**Magma depends on discord.py rewrite**

### Help and support:

There is a very basic working example of a cog implementing Magma under examples which you can use for reference.
